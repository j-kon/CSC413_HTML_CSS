                  <p id="note">This book is divided into subsections, which are grouped into sections,
                    which come together to make chapters, which are lumped finally into five
                    parts. (When you write a book, you get to know your bookâ€™s structure pretty
                    well. After months of writing, you find yourself dreaming in sections and
                    chapters when you go to bed at night.) The parts of the book are listed here.
